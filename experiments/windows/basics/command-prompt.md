If you see this with your username instead of mine, that's good! Your command prompt is running as a normal user.

If you see this instead, proceed with caution as your command prompt is running with Administrator priviledges.

Well done! You might already be familiar with interacting with Apps that have a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) by using a mouse or touch screen. Think of the Command Prompt in Windows as a special App or tool that allows us to "talk" to the computer's operating system by using the keyboard. This kind of tool is generally referred to as a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) or [TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface), and we'll use them often for doing powerful things related to software development.
