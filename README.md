# Welcome to the learning-to-code repository!
This repo was created to help my nephew get started on some summer projects involving technology. It may evolve over time and may be helpful regardless of your age.

## Getting Started
The following are good ways to learn useful concepts and skills right now, for free, with extremely low risk, all done within a web browser. What is the risk you wonder? The links point to really nice learning websites that look good today, but I have no control over how they will look tomorrow. That's it.
* Coding: W3Schools [JavaScript tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - No account needed
* Coding: HackerRank [10 Days of JavaScript](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript) - Account required, but worth it
* More, comming soon!

## Guided Experiments
The following experiments can guide you to deeper concepts and skills with some inherent risks. What are the risks you wonder? Worst case, you accidentally delete important files that prevent the computer you're using from working correctly. Sounds scary, right? Best case, you learn how to avoid that and really grow your skills. No risk, no reward. Proceed with caution, follow my guidance, and you'll be ok.

### Raspberry Pi Experiments
You're going to need a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). Which one though? [This one](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-8GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B08956GVXN/) or [this one](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Ultimate-Starter-Clear/dp/B07BC567TW/) will do. Perhaps there is a birthday coming up, or yardwork to earn such a gift! Why use a Raspberry Pi? Because it comes loaded with learning tools and is very tolerant of serious mistakes, which are normal while learning, that perhaps your laptop won't tolerate as well.
* Experiment 1 - Coming soon!

### Windows Experiments
[Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system#Microsoft_Windows) is a familiar [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) in which we can perform experiments, run commands, and build software applications. In addition to the experiments, we'll go over a few things to help prevent hurting your Windows machine.
* Experiment 1 - Coming soon!

### Linux Experiments
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system#Linux) is a widely used [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) for software development. There are several ways to obtain and use a Linux machine. Hint: Raspberry Pi comes with Linux already installed! There are also ways to run Linux within Windows!
* Experiment 1 - Coming soon!
